     and error-prone compared to expressing the logic right-side-out as if one were
     simply yielding samples. additionally, any internal state which must persist across
     callback invocations must be static, or stored elsewhere.
     
     the solution is to decouple the callback into the parent callback function, run
     once per buffer, and a child coroutine, which simply yields samples according to
     whatever logic and loop structures it wants.
     
     it would be possible to do this with a regular thread, except that context switches
     between soft-realtime OS threads would break the hard-realtime requirement for code
     running within the audio subsystem. */
